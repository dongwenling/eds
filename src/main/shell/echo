-n表示不换行
#!/bin/bash

name="Tom"
age=20
height=175
weight=62

echo -n "${name} is ${age} years old, "
echo -n "${height}cm in height "
echo "and ${weight}kg in weight."
echo "Thank you!"
结果：
Tom is 20 years old, 175cm in height and 62kg in weight.
Thank you!


echo不会解析以\开头的转义字符
[root@localhost ~]# echo "hello \nworld"
hello \nworld

可以加上-e，来解释转义字符（-c,echo不换行）
echo -e "abc \c"
eg:
#!/bin/bash

name="Tom"
age=20
height=175
weight=62

echo -e "${name} is ${age} years old, \c"
echo -e "${height}cm in height \c"
echo "and ${weight}kg in weight."
echo "Thank you!"
结果：
Tom is 20 years old, 175cm in height and 62kg in weight.
Thank you!
